# This script answer the following question:
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

# Read in the PM2.5 data.
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

# Read in the source classification code data
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Subset NEI to be just Baltimore City data.
data <- NEI[NEI$fips == 24510,]

# Get the row indices of the vehicle related SCC numbers
vehicle <- grep('[Vv][Ee][Hh]',SCC$Short.Name)

# Get the SCC numbers associated with those indices
scc_veh <- SCC$SCC[vehicle]

# Subset the Baltimore City data by the SCC numbers that exists in scc_veh
motor_vehicles <- data[data$SCC %in% scc_veh,]

# Subset data by year and then sum the emissions.
sub_data <- aggregate(motor_vehicles$Emissions, list(motor_vehicles$year), sum)

# Plot year on the x axis and total on the y. Make the plot a line type, set the title,
# and then set the x and y axis titles. We are also ensuring there are no tick marks on the
# x axis, so we can set them with the axis command.
